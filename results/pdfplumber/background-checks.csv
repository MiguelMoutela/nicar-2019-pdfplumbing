"*Refers to frames, receivers and other firearms that are not either handguns or long guns (rifles or shotguns), such as firearms having a pistol grip that expel a shotgun shell
NOTES:
**Multiple (multiple types of firearms selected)
Some states may reflect lower than expected numbers for handgun checks based on varying state laws pertaining to handgun permits Since the permit check is done in place of the NICS check in most of the affected states, the low handgun statistics are often balanced out by a higher number of handgun permit checks
DISCLAIMERS:
These statistics represent the number of firearm background checks initiated through the NICS  They do not represent the number of firearms sold  Based on varying state laws and purchase scenarios, a one-to-one correlation cannot be made between a firearm background check and a firearm sale",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
